# About Me
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from [Southern Oregon University](https://sou.edu/) in March 2025.

I have a passion for education and have created a web application called [Graph Creator](https://nolestites.com/GraphCreator) to help students and faculty with their work.

I am research-focused, having always been curious about many things in life. I work to understand why things are the way they are or how to improve them. An instance of this is my funded [Quantum Computing Research](https://github.com/NoleStites/STEM-REx).

I reside in [Houston, TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston) with my two sweet dogs Kashyyyk and Weasley.
